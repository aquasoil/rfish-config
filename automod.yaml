    Hello /u/{{author}}, Unfortunately, since your account is under 7 days old (1 week) and new account spam makes up a significant portion of all spam, your post was automatically removed. However, you may still contribute by commenting on existing posts in /r/fish! If you believe this is a legitimate submission, please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/fish&subject=Request for post review - account age) to have them manually review your post, or wait until your reddit account comes of age and try again. Thank you!
